# Hockey, Hockey, Hockey

This dashboard uses the official, semi documented NHL api to ensure that data is always up to date once you hit refresh, and will remain up to date as the season progresses.

## Stories to tell

- [ ] This season in data
- [ ] Structure of the NHL

This work would not have been possible without those heroes working hard to create community documentation for the NHL API, and of couse the legends at the NHL for making all this data available free of charge.

Go Leafs Go! This'll be the year!
